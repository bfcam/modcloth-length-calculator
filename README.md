# modcloth-length-calculator
Modcloth (http://www.modcloth.com) often lists only lengths for dresses and skirts in a few sizes (such as XS and 2X only). It would be nice to know the lengths for all sizes! This little web app uses simple linear interpolation to determine a best guess for lengths for each sizes. Dedicated to everyone on the Modcloth BST on facebook who was having issues with this! Enjoy.
